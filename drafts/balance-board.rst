Problem
=========

What problem am I trying to solve?

Up until very recently (the pandemic) I rode my bike to work everyday.
I still have to go into the office, but the schedule is quite a bit different.
I enjoy riding my bike the vast majority of the time, but most of the year
I require a shower after the ride.  This is fine when you plan to work an
8 hour day, but it is more of a hassle when working more erratically in the 
office.  Even prior to the pandemic, there were occasional days when it
would help a lot to make into the office and not need a shower.

Occasionally, I also meet my family elsewhere in the city, and it is painful to load
up my bike on the car.  This primarily because it requires planning ahead.

Reasons
--------

1. Avoid showers when reaching the office

2. Bike is frustrating when joining other transportation.

Potential Solutions
=====================

1. Electric Bike

A little expensive.  DIY is an option, but the size is mostly the problem.  If I'm
not going to ride my bike, I want something different and ideally smaller.

2. Electric Scooter

One of the first things I considered.  The wants you can rent are quite fun, but
still seems a little big.  

3. Electric Skateboard (eskate)

I'm assuming being able to ride a normal skateboard is almost a prerequisite 
(see resource 11). Braking also seems a bit suspect.  Pretty appealing though 
for the form factor. Size and weight would be perfect.  Remote is also a bit 
scary.  My typical ride has pretty good surfaces, but not perfect.  I would 
prefer not to eat it on a slightly uneven concrete joint.

4. Single Wheel Balance Board (SWBB)

I started seeing this form factor around the city, and it looks very appealing.
Form factor looks great.  Single wheel with lots of surface area seems advantageous
compared to the tiny skateboard wheels.

Selection
==========

It is pretty obvious from my non-rigorous analysis of alternatives above that I 
chose the Single Wheel Balance Board.

Risks/Concerns
==============

1. Not trivial to ride - One of my main drivers is to arrive at my location without
needing a shower.  I'm looking to pretty comfortably cruise to my location.

**Response:** Riding something similar before building would be ideal, but
I don't know anyone with anything.  The pandemic does not help with this problem.
I have instead filled myself with YouTube confidence.

2. Maturity of DIY Tech - I will likely hit this in more detail later, but this
is a relatively new DIY project on the scale of the internet.  My main use for
this project is transportation, so minimum failures is a positive.  In the case
of a balance board, failure takes on a little more of a safety perspective, i.e.
when it fails, you fall off.  All motorized projects have this problem, but 
a self balancing option is slightly worse.

**Response:**  There is some very impressive DIY/open source work, and the 
electronic skateboard community appears to be slightly more mature than SWBB.
There are a few success stories on which to hang our hat.

3. Availability of parts - One of the electronic skateboard forums in the 
resources had a whole sticky post on purchasing parts in that DIY community.
In summary, as with many niche hobby areas, parts are not mainstream.  You
aren't going to pick up these items from Amazon and show up in 2 days with 
Prime.

**Response:** Surprisingly, there are relatively few parts required, and
they will be discussed in detail later.  The most troubling part is the 
combined wheel moter itself.  There just aren't many other products that
require a part like this.  Low demand means low supply and few options.
The motor controller is a bit concerning, but other projects and 
communities (like the DIY eskate ) use something very similar.
