My intent with creating this blog/website is primarily to capture my own
process and thoughts on personal projects.  The internet provides so much
knowledge, and I would like to do my part.

I used to think it wasn't valuable to simply regurgitate what I had gained
from my internet searches and endeavors, but the more projects I tackle, 
the more I value people's personal captures of their projects.  To fully
plan a complex project it often takes absorbing the successes and choices
of many iterations.  All that to say, I now think there is a lot of value
in capturing "redundancies".

My initial plan is to write the content of this site somewhat selfishly.
A means to institute slightly more rigor on myself above and beyond simply
keeping 90 chrome tabs open at a given time.  With any luck, someone else 
in this world will benefit.
