Purpose
========

As is often the case for many of my DIY projects, one the first steps I
take is a cost assessment and/or product search.  Is there already something
that does what I want?  And how much does it cost?  What are the advantages
and disadvantages to doing it myself?  I'll try to answer all those questions
in a later post, but for now I'll look at cost.

Cost Assessment
================

Assuming I move forward with this project, I will go into greater detail
for each of these components, but just prices for now.  I try to include
shipping on all items for completeness.

So a total of $486.

That's a pretty steep price tag for for something of this complexity.  I'm generally not shy
about the price tag of DIY projects, but it is definitely dependent on how the project
falls in my comfort zone.  This would have been a great project while I was in college, but
I don't enough endless free time to debug.
